# Fill in the Gaps
A fill-in-the-gaps quiz, created for the Udacity Nanodegree "Intro to Programming".
This is a simple, pure command line game.

The player can select one of three level (easy, medium or hard).
Also the player can select the number of wrong guesses allowed.

Once both choices are made, the game starts.
The player is now asked to fill one gap after the other.
If all gaps are filled, the game ends with a win for the player. 
If makes more than the allowed number of wrong guesses, the game ends with a loss for the player.
